#### A simple ONE click feedback tool. 

## The problem
Surveys take too long, 1-5 star feedback is too narrow, for example if the food was rubbish but the service was great, the human suffers.

## The solution
A ONE click feed back two with two dimensions, for example...

__Takeout__
Sweet, Sour

__Coffee__
Speed, Taste

__Product__
Performance, Support

__Pizza__
Toppings, Temperature
